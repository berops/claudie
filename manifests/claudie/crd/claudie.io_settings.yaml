                      Specifies the cluster dynamic configuration which will replace
                      the default claudie provided configuration.

                      Be careful when replacing the default configuration as you may break
                      the 'settings' configurable options for the role definition in the
                      InputManifest.

                      If you need to change the default behaviour, it is advisable to start
                      with the default configuration provided by claudie, which matches the
                      configurable options in the InputManifest, and then make your own changes
                      from there.
