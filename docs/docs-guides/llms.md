# LLMs File Overview

The LLMs files are located in the root directory of the page. We generate two files:

- **\`llms.txt\`** - contains a short description of each relevant page.  
- **\`llms-full.txt\`** - aggregates all relevant content from the entire website into a single Markdown file.

## Generating LLMs Files

To generate `llms.txt`, you can use any online metadata generator - or simply write your own short descriptions for each webpage/link manually.
For generating content you can use tools like [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/).  

> **Tip:** To sign up for Firecrawl without using your main email, you can use a temporary email service like [10MinuteMail](https://10minutemail.com/).

When you are finished with documantation of you feature don't forget to modify `llms-full.txt` file. You just add content of your created/modified .md file into `llms-full.txt`.
