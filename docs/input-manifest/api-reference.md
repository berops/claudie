# Settings API reference

Settings are definitions that allow you to replace the defaults used by Claudie when creating a cluster, as defined in the [InputManifest](#inputmanifest-api-reference).

These settings can be applied to pre-defined places in the InputManifest and are identified by the `settingsRef` field.

Settings are parsed using [Go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template). During this process, the types, that are parsed from the InputManifest, are also passed in, allowing you to reference them within the templates.

## Spec

 Specification of the desired setting/s that should be applied when building the cluster.

 -  `envoy` [Envoy](#envoy)

    Optional override of the envoy configurations used on the loadbalancer nodes.


## Envoy

 This allows you to replace the listener and cluster configurations used when deploying Envoy proxies on load balancer nodes attached to Kubernetes clusters.

 The mechanism used to replace the default configurations used by Claudie is as described in the [dynamic configuration documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/start/quick-start/configuration-dynamic-filesystem)

 To write your own configurations you can follow the official [envoy documentation]( https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/)

!!! note "The default configurations used by claudie implement the [settings](#role) options from the Role definition. If you provide your own configuration these may break if you do not consider them."

 When Claudie parses the provided configurations, the context of the [role](#role) is available and can be referenced within them.

 - `lds`

    Replaces the listener configuration of the envoy proxy.

 - `cds`

    Replaces the cluster configuration of the envoy proxy.

## Nodepools

Collection of static and dynamic nodepool specification, to be referenced in the `kubernetes` or `loadBalancer` clusters.

- `dynamic` [Dynamic](#dynamic)

  List of dynamically to-be-created nodepools of not yet existing machines, used for Kubernetes or loadbalancer clusters.

  These are only blueprints, and will only be created per reference in `kubernetes` or `loadBalancer` clusters. E.g. if the nodepool isn't used, it won't even be created. Or if the same nodepool is used in two different clusters, it will be created twice.
In OOP analogy, a dynamic nodepool would be a class that would get instantiated `N >= 0` times depending on which clusters reference it.

- `static` [Static](#static)

  List of static nodepools of already existing machines, not provisioned by Claudie, used for Kubernetes (see [requirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#before-you-begin)) or loadbalancer clusters. These can be baremetal servers or VMs with IPs assigned. Claudie is able to join them into existing clusters, or provision clusters solely on the static nodepools. Typically we'll find these being used in on-premises scenarios, or hybrid-cloud clusters.

## Dynamic

Dynamic nodepools are defined for cloud provider machines that Claudie is expected to provision.

- `name`

  Name of the nodepool. The name is limited by 14 characters. Each nodepool will have a random hash appended to the name, so the whole name will be of format `<name>-<hash>`.

- `provideSpec` [Provider spec](#provider-spec)

  Collection of provider data to be used while creating the nodepool.

- `count`

  Number of the nodes in the nodepool. Maximum value of 255.  Mutually exclusive with `autoscaler`.

  Type of the machines in the nodepool.

  Currently, only AMD64 machines are supported.

- `machineSpec`

  Further describes the selected server type, if available by the cloud provider.

  - `cpuCount`: specifies the number of cpu to be used by the `serverType`
  - `memory`: specifies the memory in GB to be used by the `serverType`

- `image`

  OS image of the machine.

  Currently, only Ubuntu 22.04 AMD64 images are supported.

- `storageDiskSize`

  The size of the storage disk on the nodes in the node pool is specified in `GB`. The OS disk is created automatically with a predefined size of `100GB` for Kubernetes nodes and `50GB` for LoadBalancer nodes.

  This field is optional; however, if a compute node pool does not define it, the default value will be used for the creation of the storage disk. Control node pools and LoadBalancer node pools ignore this field.

  The default value for this field is `50`, with a minimum value also set to `50`. This value is only applicable to compute nodes. If the disk size is set to `0`, no storage disk will be created for any nodes in the particular node pool.

- `autoscaler` [Autoscaler Configuration](#autoscaler-configuration)

  Autoscaler configuration for this nodepool. Mutually exclusive with `count`.

- `labels`

  Map of user defined labels, which will be applied on every node in the node pool. This field is optional.

  To see the default labels Claudie applies on each node, refer to [this section](#default-labels).

- `annotations`

  Map of user defined annotations, which will be applied on every node in the node pool. This field is optional.

  You can use Kubernetes annotations to attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata. Clients such as tools and libraries can retrieve this metadata.

- `taints` [v1.Taint](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.25/#taint-v1-core)

  Array of user defined taints, which will be applied on every node in the node pool. This field is optional.

  To see the default taints Claudie applies on each node, refer to [this section](#default-taints).

## Provider Spec
