Some Claudie aspects can be configured via environment variables read from a ConfigMap in the namespace where Claudie is deployed.

These values allow you to customize endpoints for individual services, log levels, and concurrency limits. The default ConfigMap that is
deployed with Claudie can be found in the [Claudie GitHub repository](https://github.com/berops/claudie/blob/master/manifests/claudie/.env).

The full list of environment variables is as follows:

```
# Log level for each individual service, can be info|debug|warn|error
GOLANG_LOG=info

TERRAFORMER_HOSTNAME=terraformer
TERRAFORMER_PORT=50052

ANSIBLER_HOSTNAME=ansibler
